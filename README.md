# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course project

Takes the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The `run_analysis.R` script takes this data and prepares it for further analysis.

1. Merges the data from the training and test sets into one large dataset. 
2. Pares down the large dataset to only include the mean and standard deviation for each observation.
3. Finds the average value for each measurement type by subject and activity.
